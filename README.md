![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

### [Live Demo](https://multiplechat.streamlit.app/)

This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload PDF files and interact with the content through a conversational interface. Powered by Google Generative AI (Gemini) and FAISS, the app enables users to ask questions from the uploaded PDF files and receive relevant answers.

## Features
- 📄 **Upload Multiple PDFs**: Upload one or more PDF files for processing.
- 🔍 **Text Extraction and Chunking**: The app extracts text from the PDFs and splits it into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
- 🧠 **Google Generative AI**: Answers user questions using AI by finding relevant information from the PDF files.
- 📦 **FAISS for Efficient Search**: Uses FAISS to create in-memory embeddings for fast similarity-based search.
- 💬 **Conversational Interface**: Ask questions and receive detailed answers based on the content of the uploaded PDF files.

## How It Works
1. **Upload PDFs**: Upload your PDF documents using the file uploader on the left sidebar.
2. **Process PDFs**: Once uploaded, the app extracts and processes text from the PDFs and stores it in-memory using FAISS.
3. **Ask Questions**: Use the question box to ask questions related to the uploaded PDFs. The app will respond with answers based on the document content.
